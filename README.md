# Computational Statistics KEN4258 Assignment 2 repository

This repository contains code for the second assignment Computational Statistics (KEN4258) course (2023-2024) at the Department of Advanced Computing Sciences, Maastricht University.

We worked in multiple notebooks and with Kaggle to speed up the experiments. Task 1 was done in ```Task1L.ipynb``` and ```Task1R.ipynb``` for the left and right Figure respectivly of Task 1. Task 3 was split into using Mutual Information (MI) and Matrix Multiplication (MM). The MI and MM notebooks are called ```Task3 v2 K=300 MI.ipynb``` and ```Task3 v2 K=300 MM.ipynb``` respectively. The notebook that uses the Banana dataset is called ```Task5 banana.ipynb```.

Students: Yannick Damoiseaux and Martijn Elands
